  Our goal is to create an Android application that simplifies the process of planning, executing, and sharing a workout. 
The target customers are students who workout, no matter the experience level. The application, at its most basic function,
allows the user to create workouts and input the weights used. There will be default, basic exercises to choose from, or the
user can input their own. The app will store these workouts as "Past Workouts" that the user can then go back and view, to
track your progress.

  Furthermore, once this core functionality is completed, we will add in the ability to share workouts, which will solve the issue of working out not being social in nature. The main issue this will solve is to allow coaches to share workouts to their players in a digital form and not on paper. This would also allow players to share the workout results back with the coaches, so that the coaches can keep track of player progress. In a similar manner, this would allow users to also share past workouts with friends. Finally, students can find partners and groups to lift with.
