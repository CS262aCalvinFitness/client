CS 262 Android Application
  Our goal is to create an Android application that simplifies the process of planning and executing a workout. 
The target customers are students who workout, no matter the experience level. The application, at its most basic function,
allows the user to create workouts and input the weights used. There will be default, basic exercises to choose from, or the
user can input their own. The app will store these workouts as "Past Workouts" that the user can then go back and view, to
track your progress.
  Furthermore, once this core functionality is completed, we will add in the ability to share workouts. This way, a coach
could create a workout for a team, and send it out to all of the players using the app. In a similar feature, we would allow
users to also share past workouts. This would allow players to share the workout results back with the coaches, so that the
coaches can keep track of player progress. Finally, students can find partners and groups to lift with.
